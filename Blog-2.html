        <p>Here We're going to talk about what are the different asset classes available today for investing that give better returns than the Traditional Fixed Deposits.</p>

        <h3>Sovereign Gold Bonds
        </h3>
        <p>So you want to invest into something safe, well what about gold it's the safest thing there is. When everything goes wrong gold rises and its average returns have been around 10% every year. Well if gold is what you like there might be a better way to invest in them.</p>
        <p>In buying physical gold there are a bunch of hidden costs included that we don't see inititally. The making charges, charges for the bank locker to store it in, the profit of the jeweller etc. So instead of buying physical gold invest in whats called <strong>The Sovereign Bonds.</strong> These are bonds that can be bought and sold at the price of gold anytime and because they're stored digitally there is not making charge, no storing charge etc. Also because they're backed by the government they are as safe as physical gold itself. </p>

        <h3>Index Funds</h3>
        <p>Now if you want slightly higher returns and are willing to take slightly higher risks for it, Index Funds might be just for you. This is where we enter the stock market. Index funds are basically funds that track the index of our country that is Nifty50 and Sensex. Since these Indexes include the top 50 and top 30 companies of the country and the money is distributed among them these are pretyy safe in the long term. Indexes has traditionally given 10% to 12% returns over the last decade which is not only enough to beat the inflation but because indexes always goes up in the long term the money almost always grows if held for decades. </p>

        <h3>Equity</h3>
        <p>If you're someone who still has more capacity for risk and desire an even higher returnand you do not mind taking out time to learn about the technicalities of the market yourself, Mutual funds and equity might just be for you. You can research about the individual stocks in the market, go through the financials of the companies. It is here that you might find companies that can give you multifold returns on your investment amount, but it is also the most risky of the three. So be careful when going for it.</p>
